JEKYLL Basic Setup

This is the basic structure of a Jekyll website.

I've made it into a github page to remove the 5-10 minutes it takes to make all the directories, write the basic content and make sure that you didn't copy something incorrectly


#Setup Jekyl
Install the jekyll gem for Ruby if you haven't already.

Download this repo either by git or downloading the zip file.

[optional] Change the content of files in _posts to your own original content

[optional] If you want to include CSS or Javascript files make a _includes folder and put the files in there

In your Command Line write "jekyll --server" without quotes.
This will finish creating all the folders and files you need except for your site as is

Browse to localhost/4000

You now have a local version of a static website. Enjoy!
