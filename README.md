JEKYLL Basic Setup

This is the basic structure of a Jekyll website.
I've made it into a github page to remove the 5-10 minutes it takes to make all the directories, write the basic content and make sure that you didn't copy something incorrectly


#Setup Jekyl
Install the jekyll gem for Ruby if you haven't already.
Download this. 
[optional] Change the content of files in _posts to your own original content 
In the Command Line/Shell of your choice write "jekyll --server" without quotes.
Browse to http:0.0.0.0:4000
Enjoy
